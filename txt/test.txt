At the present I go to school, so I am very busy on weekdays. Because of this, unfortunately, I can not help in the house as often as my parents wish. However, I do my best to find the time to clean house. Every morning I get up and without any loss of time, I do my bed and go to the bathroom. Yawning, I wash my face, then I brush my teeth and go to have breakfast. After breakfast, I always wash the dishes myself after me and my family, because my mom and dad leave for work before me. They have no time to wash the dishes. At 8 o clock sharp, I make my way to the school and at 4 on the dot I come back home. On my return, I cook something easy so that I might eat, and then I get down to the lessons. Lessons take me from half an hour to two hours a day. It all depends on how much homework our teacher gives to us. Then I put all the books and notebooks into place and start cleaning my room. Every day I dust. Every other day I vacuum. Sometimes in the evening we go shopping together with dad. From time to time, I help my mom wash, iron and do spring cleaning. But this happens not quite often. On the weekend I rest, meet friends, play in the yard and in the park across the street. She often gets angry with me for this, so I try to study well and make her happy making good progress in studies. TV-set has become a part of our lives many years ago. Watching TV, we learn a lot of information. The most important information coming from TV is certainly news. Thanks to the news we keep track of events of both domestic and foreign policy. However, not all programs are of use to us. Probably on the contrary - they only hamper our development, making us weak and inactive. Therefore, it is impossible to say that TV is 100 boon. So the idiot box with TV shows, does it do more good or harm? Giving a clear answer is impossible. What will happen if we do not turn on TV at all? We wont be aware of what is going on in the world and in the country. You can, of course, learn the news through the Internet, but there are not many people who are used to doing so. Particularly it is true for people over 50. Let us consider another situation. All day long a person lies on the sofa or sits in the armchair and watches the box round the clock. Who will like this kind of lifestyle of couch potato? Answer: nobody! However, this attitude to life also harms the main hero - lazy viewer. Why? Firstly, he is passive, which in future will lead to the deterioration of his health and quality of life. Secondly, he watches everything just channel-hopping. We all know that 90 of the information on television is neither educational nor cognitive. They aim simply to draw the audience attention, not to mention useless ads. If you need to send a parcel or get the parcel, buy stamps and subscribe to a newspaper or a magazine, you need to go to the post-office. You can send not only a telegram, but also a money transfer.

These opportunities make life of an ordinary citizen easier. Now you should not waste time on trying to find the right office or bank. Everything is within reach. Just two days ago I went to the post office to send a parcel to my niece. Since I live in Italy for a certain period of time, and my family lives in Germany, I had to resort to the services of the post-office. The fact is that my niece is birthday is in a week, so I wrapped up a package with gifts in advance and sent it to the appropriate address. Postal workers asked me to pass the parcel so that they might weigh it. So did I. Then I paid for stamps that were put on the parcel. Everything went quickly and at the highest level. I was given a check and they wished me to have a good day. There is no point in saying that medicine plays an important role in the lives of all people. The fact that good health is more important than good medicine cannot be denied without doubt. However, what is to do if you suddenly came down with a serious disease?
